  <h1>BahuBali</h1>
  <p> A mask then falls from the cliffs, and realizing it possesses feminine features, Shivudu finally
    succeeds in scaling the mountain in order to find the woman the mask belongs. Upon reaching the top,
    he sees a beautiful woman named Avantika fighting Mahishmati soldiers. He discovers that she is a member 
    of a local resistance group dedicated to overthrowing the tyrannical king of Mahishmati, Lord Bhallaladeva, 
    and rescuing royal captive Princess Devasena. Shivudu is immediately smitten with Avantika and secretly follows
    her, even managing to draw a tattoo on her hand while she sleeps. When she discovers Shivudu she attacks him, but
    he outmaneuvers her and returns her mask. Realizing he scaled the entire mountain to find her, she reciprocates his 
    feelings. The pair are later attacked by more soldiers, and after defeating them, Shivudu pledges to rescue Devasena
    himself and departs for Mahishmati. He secretly enters the city on Bhallaladevaâ€™s birthday and assists in erecting a gigantic
    statue of the king. In the process, he is recognized by a worker, who then leads the other workers in chanting 'Baahubali,' to
    Shivudu's confusion and Bhallaladeva's displeasure. Shivudu later infiltrates the royal palace disguised as a soldier and distracts 
    Bhallaladeva and his guards long enough for him to rescue Devasena. Bhallaladeva sends his son, Bhadra, 
    and the royal family's loyal slave Kattappa to recapture Devasena. In the ensuing fight, Shivudu beheads Bhadra 
    as both the Amburi tribe and resistance warriors arrive. Kattappa lunges at Shivudu, but stops short of attacking him upon seeing
    his face. He falls into submission at Shivudu's feet, proclaiming him to be 'Baahubali'.</p>
